# tetris-15

## Development
To improve my skills and work on my next project I have decided to attempt a game of tetris. I think that this will help to impove my javascript skills and also help further with my logic.

I will be applying code that allows the shapes to move about the screen based on the KeyUp/Down keys.

I will try to create as much code as I can before looking at videos and try to use the documentation in w3 schools and MDN documentation first. If I can successfully get my game working I will link this to a long term fun project that I am challenging myself to complete. The 15 links to 24 coding challenges that I will complete in no linear order (who needs linear eh).

## resources
I am currently watching game making on videos made by Ania Kubow to help improve my skills watching her challenges.
